# A Windows 'grep' like tool

This utility started life in assembler on an Intel 8086 processor.

It progressed through 16-bit Windows, and was converted, well re-written in C.

The recent is WIN32, but hope to also compile in WIN64.

And now it is in a repo I can clone it into 64-bit Ubuntu, and do a unix port. This part is very much a work in progress.

Enjoy.

Geoff.
